### Abstract
India implemented a prolonged lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the mental health difficulties and the influence of lockdown stressors among Indian higher education students and employees in the government and private sectors during the COVID-19 lockdown. Basic demographic, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), perceived stress scale (PSS), and sleep quality data were collected from 676 participants using a web-based cross-sectional survey. Among the participants, the overall prevalence of GAD was 22.9%, and the prevalence of PSS was 15.7% (low), 79.4% (medium), and 4.7% (high). Younger participants reported higher GAD and PSS symptoms. Lockdown stressors significantly correlated with GAD and PSS. Additionally, increased mobile phone usage significantly affected sleep latency and sleep quality (p < 0.001). Continuous monitoring of sleep and the psychological impacts of outbreaks should become standard practice as part of global preparedness measures.
